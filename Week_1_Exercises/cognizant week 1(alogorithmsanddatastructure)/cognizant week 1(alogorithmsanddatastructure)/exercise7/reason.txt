Concept of Recursion

Recursion: A method in which a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem.
Base Case: The condition under which the recursion ends, preventing infinite recursion.
Recursive Case: The part where the function calls itself with a smaller or simpler input.
Simplification: Recursion can make certain problems easier to solve by breaking them down into simpler, more manageable subproblems.



Summary
Recursion simplifies the problem of financial forecasting by breaking it down into 
smaller subproblems. The recursive approach has a time complexity of 
ùëÇ(ùëõ)O(n). By using memoization, we can optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation. 
An iterative approach can further enhance efficiency by reducing space complexity.
