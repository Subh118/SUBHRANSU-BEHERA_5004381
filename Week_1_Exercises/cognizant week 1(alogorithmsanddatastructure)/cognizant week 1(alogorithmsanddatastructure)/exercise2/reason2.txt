Big O Notation
Definition: Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's running time, providing a
worst-case scenario for how the time or space grows as the input size increases.
Purpose: It helps in analyzing and comparing the efficiency of algorithms, allowing
us to predict their behavior with large inputs.


Search Operation Scenarios
Best Case: The scenario where the search operation takes the least time (e.g., the item is the first element).
Average Case: The expected time taken by the search operation, averaging over all possible inputs.
Worst Case: The scenario where the search operation takes the most time 
(e.g., the item is not found or is the last element).


Time Complexity Comparison

Linear Search:
Best Case: O(1) (item is the first element)
Average Case: O(n/2) = O(n)
Worst Case: O(n) (item is the last element or not found)

Binary Search:
Best Case: O(1) (item is the middle element)
Average Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(log n) (item not found)
  


Suitable Algorithm for the Platform

Binary Search: More suitable for the e-commerce platform because:
Efficiency: It has a lower time complexity (O(log n)) compared to linear search (O(n)), 
making it faster for large datasets.
Requirement: The array needs to be sorted, but this is a one-time cost, after which searches are 
much faster.

Summary:
Using a binary search over a sorted array is generally more efficient for search 
operations on an e-commerce platform due to its O(log n) time complexity, providing 
faster search times for large inventories.
